# Expanded XCLAIM
This is a heavily WIP implementation.

The smart contract is currently in progress. A sample vault implementation will follow.

# Current schedule:
## Week 17-21 Aug
* Implement majority of smart contract, including checkpoint transaction verification
* Figure out technical details on and initiate implementation of vault and client protocols, including generation of e.g. issue and checkpoint transactions
#### Friday update
* Issue transaction verification in progress; currently working on script validation. Checkpoint verification will mirror issue verification and should not pose a problem.
* Experimenting with vault implementation and building transactions, assuming library/RPC cooperates no significant issues are foreseen
* TODO: reorganise source into a better layout
## Week 24-28 Aug
* Finalise implementation for vault and client. Target: functional demo
* Report: revise protocol section to match any details ironed out during implementation.
* Report: flesh out feasibility analysis based on implementation costs. Provide implementation overview/description section? Compare to previous solutions i.e. XCLAIM, potentially e.g. atomic swap for comprehensiveness
## Week 31 Aug - 3 Sep
* Report: add figures where necessary. Final proofreading, ensure all sections are covered, polish final details.
* Schedule demo, finalise demo script
## 4 Sep at 14:00: report and code archive submission
